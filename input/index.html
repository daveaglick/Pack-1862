							<h4>What ages does my child need to be?</h4>

							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<img src="images/bobcat.jpg">
									<h5>Bobcat</h5>
									<p>The Bobcat badge is earned prior to all other ranks. The Bobcat badge is an introduction to Cub Scouting’s values and some of it’s methods such as the Cub Scout sign.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
										<img src="images/lion.jpg">
									<h5>Lion</h5>
									<p>The Lion rank is for Scouts who are in kindergarten or the year prior to first grade. To earn the Lion badge, a Scout must complete five required adventures with the den or family.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
										<img src="images/tiger.jpg">
									<h5>Tiger</h5>
									<p>The Tiger rank is for Scouts who are in first grade. At this level, each scout needs an adult partner for each activity. To earn the Tiger badge, a Scout must complete six required adventures with the den or family and one elective adventure of the den or family’s choosing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
										<img src="images/wolf.jpg">
									<h5>Wolf</h5>
									<p>The Wolf rank is for Scouts who are in second grade. To earn the Wolf badge, a Scout must complete six required adventures and one elective adventure.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
										<img src="images/bear.jpg">
									<h5>Bear</h5>
									<p>The Bear rank is for Scouts who are in third grade. To earn the Bear badge, a Scout must complete six required adventures and one elective adventure.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
										<img src="images/webelos.png">
									<h5>Webelos and Arrow of Light</h5>
									<p>
										Webelos dens are for Scouts who are in fourth or fifth grade. Webelos Scouts get to work on the five required Webelos adventures and choose two of the
										18 elective adventures that are shared by the Webelos and Arrow of Light ranks. The highest rank in Cub Scouting is the Arrow of Light. Earning this rank prepares a Webelos Scout to join a Scouts BSA Troop.

							<h4>How much are the dues?</h4>
							<p>
								Our dues are $160 for the entire program year. That covers supplies, your Pinewood Derby car and Raingutter Regatta boat, our Pack dues to district and council,
								some food and drink for campouts and activities, and more. We think scouting ranks among the best value-for-money activities you can participate in.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you need to pay your dues, you can do so by writing a check to "Pack 1862" and giving it to our Treasurer, your Den Leader, or one of the other leaders.
								You can also <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/CubScoutPack1862">pay via Paypal to CubScoutPack1862</a>, but please add $3 to the payment to cover transaction fees.
							</p>

							<h4>Is anything expected of parents?</h4>
							<p>
								Every household in our pack is required to volunteer in at least one position. Scouting is an adult-participatory activity and it's enriching for you,
								for your scout(s), and for the unit to have everyone involved. We can't do it without you!
							</p>

							<h4>Where can I order cool Pack 1862 gear?</h4>
							<p>
								I'm glad you asked! Pack 1862 now has an online store with shirts, bags, and more:
								<a href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/pack-1862/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/pack-1862/</a>.
								Full disclosure: the pack will earn a little bit in fundraising on every sale - that part can’t be turned off (we would set the price at cost if we could).
